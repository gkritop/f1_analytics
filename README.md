# Monaco GP

Created a dashboard, using PowerBi, that encapsulates the comprehensive insights drawn from our analysis, presenting a visual narrative of our findings.

# Mclaren

The script performs diverse operations on the dataset stored in McLaren.csv. It starts by loading the data into a Pandas DataFrame and provides a summary of the data structure and types. Basic operations include calculating the average laps and filtering data for a specific driver, while missing values in certain columns are handled by filling them with appropriate values. The script also sorts and saves the processed data to a new CSV file. In addition, it generates summary statistics, manipulates data, and exports the filtered results.

# Ferrari 

The script provides a comprehensive analysis of the Ferrari racing data. It includes data loading and preprocessing, descriptive statistics, grouped calculations, data visualization, and statistical analysis using ANOVA. The objective is to gain insights into driver performance, track characteristics, and factors influencing race outcomes to aid in further analysis and strategic decision-making in racing contexts.

# RedBull

The provided Python code effectively handles data analysis tasks on a dataset containing Red Bull racing data, focusing on three key metrics: the average number of laps completed, the standard deviation of final positions, and the Pearson correlation coefficient between pit stops and final positions.

# Mercedes

The Python code provided performs efficient data processing and analysis on Mercedes racing data from a CSV file. The script executes three main tasks: adjusting driver positions based on retirement status, analyzing laps completed, and manipulating arrays for statistical insights.
